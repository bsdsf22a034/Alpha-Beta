# Alpha-Beta
Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique used in the minimax algorithm, which is commonly applied in game theory and artificial intelligence, particularly for two-player games like chess or tic-tac-toe. The primary goal of alpha-beta pruning is to reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the search tree, allowing for deeper searches in a given time frame.

Key Concepts
Minimax Algorithm: This algorithm aims to minimize the possible loss in a worst-case scenario. In a two-player game, one player (the maximizer) tries to maximize their score while the other player (the minimizer) aims to minimize it.

Alpha and Beta Values:

Alpha: The best value that the maximizer (Player 1) can guarantee at that level or above. It starts at negative infinity.
Beta: The best value that the minimizer (Player 2) can guarantee at that level or above. It starts at positive infinity.
Pruning Process: As the algorithm explores the game tree:

If the minimizer finds a move that is worse than the current alpha value, it can prune that branch, as it will not lead to a better outcome for the maximizer.
Conversely, if the maximizer finds a move that is better than the current beta value, it can prune that branch, as it will not lead to a better outcome for the minimizer.
Advantages
Efficiency: By pruning branches that won't affect the final decision, alpha-beta pruning significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated, which can allow the algorithm to search deeper into the game tree.
Speed: In practice, it can allow for searches that are exponentially faster than the standard minimax approach.
Implementation
Alpha-beta pruning can be implemented in a depth-first search algorithm. The efficiency of the pruning is influenced by the order in which moves are evaluated. If the best moves are evaluated first, the algorithm can prune more branches.

Conclusion
Alpha-beta pruning is a powerful technique for enhancing the performance of the minimax algorithm in competitive games. By minimizing unnecessary calculations, it allows AI players to make more informed decisions more quickly.
